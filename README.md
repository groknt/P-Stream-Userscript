# Fork abandoned

> [!CAUTION]
> This userscript may eventually become outdated and/or cease to function.

> [!NOTE]
> The reason for abandoning this userscript is quite simple, really. I have transformed my entertainment setup from one based around P-Stream along with the associated 'FED API' to one which utilises Stremio with AIOStreams, many embedded addons and customisations, and most importantly, Real-Debrid.

> [!NOTE]
> **TL;DR:** I do not use P-Stream or its ecosystem anymore.

# Userscript
Userscript replacement for the P-Stream extension

1. Install a user script extension (e.g., Violentmonkey)
2. [Download](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groknt/P-Stream-Userscript/main/p-stream.user.js) the script!
3. Enable it for P-Stream!

This does not currently work in Safari or Orion due to Webkit’s limitations with webRequest APIs. :(

Thanks to Duplicake for the incredible help building this!
